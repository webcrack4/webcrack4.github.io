    From afar: Pull to targets and grant a stack of Insatiable Dance. While close: Push off targets, then
    use primary or secondary attacks to perform a followup. Primary followup grants a stack of
    Insatiable Dance. Secondary followup expends stacks and creates a 50 health healing orb per stack.
